# The Data Team

The first thing to know when building a data science organization is that data science is a team sport. It takes a large group of people working together to solve real, practical data science projects. Those people include the data scientists, the managers of those data scientists, and data engineers who perform and develop the infrastructure. There are also people who your team will have contact with outside of the data science team. 

The data science team members work together as a unit. Often, each of these people is working on an individual project, or a sub-problem of a larger data science problem. And then they come together and have joint group meetings and joint presentations, where they discuss their ideas. They also interact with external folks either directly through individual meetings with people outside of the data science team or through the data science manager. Either way, they have to be able to communicate what's going on with the data science infrastructure and what's going on with the data science team. 

# When Do You Need Data Science?

The way in which you'll interact with data science depends a little bit on what kind of organization you are. To some extent, it depends a lot on the size of your organization. 

## The Startup

When you're just a start up, at an early stage company, or you're just one person with a very small team you may not need to worry so much about how to do experimentation, how to do machine learning, how to do prediction and downstream calculations. The first order of business is just making sure your data house is in order. The way to do that is to make sure you focus on infrastructure. 

The first thing that you need to do is build out the infrastructure for storing the data, the databases and so forth. The software that's going to be run to pull those data, the servers that are going to serve
the data to other people, and the servers that you'll interact with
yourself in order to get the data out. All of that requires infrastructure building. So often the first people that you
get to hire into a data science team are not people that you would necessarily called data scientists in the sense that they're not analyzing the data, they're not doing machine learning. They might do a little bit of that but mostly they're involved on just making sure the machine is running, making sure the data's getting collected,
it's secure, it's stored and so forth. 

## The Mid-Sized Organization

When you're a mid-size organization, then hopefully you've got the basic infrastructure in place and you can start thinking about building out your real data science team. To do that you can bring on board people that are actually called data scientists and those are the folks who will then actually use the data. They might run some experiments. They might build machine learning algorithms. They might analyze the data to see if you can identify any patterns or trends in behavior that you care about. So at that point, you're thinking about actually building out the data science team. You're also thinking about implementing these data science ideas and products. 

For example, the data scientist might build something like a machine learning algorithm that predicts consumer behavior. Once you have that algorithm built out, you might need to implement it back on to your system. And you might need to scale it up, so that it can be run on the whole data set. You might want to build some sort of visualization, that people who aren't necessarily data scientists can interact with. And so, that would be turning it back over to the data engineering team. That means there are still infrastructure concerns, because you have a large set of data that you've hopefully collected at this point. You need to be secure about it, you need to have a database, you need to be able to scale it. But, now you're sort of graduating into a more complete view of data science. 

## Large Organizations

For a large organization you have all those same sorts of things. You now have a data infrastructure, you might have a data science team that's running experiments. You may be using those experiments to make decisions. But now you have one additional component, which is really managing the team and keeping everybody on task and coordinated. So at this point the data science manager role becomes a little bit more involved, in the sense that you might be coordinating multiple teams of data scientists working on different projects. You might have a team that works exclusively on building machine learning projects. You might have another team that works exclusively on running experiments and inferring what you can from those experiments. 

Someone has to be in charge of coordinating those activities making sure they're connected to the right people within your organization. Whether that's the marketing team, the business group or whoever else that you're collaborating with. You have to be able to connect those people and so at that scale the full data science infrastructure is in place.


# Qualifications & Skills

## Data Engineer

One of the key members of a data science team is a data engineer. What does a data engineer do? They might do things like build infrastructure, so they would build out your databases and the hardware for that. That might involve purchasing equipment and organizing it within your organization. Or they might build out your system for actually computing on that infrastructure, whether it's what servers they're going to buy and how they're going to organize that. And what software they're going to run on top of the database, what software they're going to run on top of the server. They might manage the data storage and use and they might monitor how those work. They might monitor what people are using which data. They might pull data out and give it to somebody. And then they might
implement production tools. 

Now each of these is a different thing, and so you might not have one person that does all of these things. Certainly at the beginning, when you're a very small organization, you might need one person that can kind of handle the entire data infrastructure. Then you might get more specialized people as you get to be a larger and larger organization. 

The question is, what skills do they need? They might need some knowledge of what's the right hardware to be looking for, both in terms of storage and in terms of computing. They need to have some knowledge about database software and they need to know a little bit about software for computing and what are the different software needs that your organization might have. In that sense, they need to be able to interact with the data scientists, once you have them. 

They need to be able to know what software they need to be able to install, what kind of data pulls that people will frequently do. That will inform the hardware choices that they're going to be making. They also need to understand data processing at scale because almost always now organizations are collecting a massive amount of data. You need to be able to run at scale those data processes and those data prediction algorithms that you've developed. Data engineers need to understand software engineering to the point where they know how they're going to interact with all these other components of the data science team. 

The background for data engineers is often computer science and computer engineering, but they could also come from other places. They might come from a quantitative background with some computer science experience that they picked up maybe in
online courses or in courses in person. Or maybe they come from information technology where they've actually been involved in infrastructure building and so forth. Not unlike with the data scientist, you might depend on what your organization needs a little bit, which of these specific backgrounds is most useful to you. But the primary thing you want to know is Can they execute those jobs that
your organization needs them to execute? Are they able to build infrastructure? Are they able to maintain the infrastructure that you need them to be able to maintain? Can they implement the data science, or machine learning algorithms, or statistical experiments, at scale for your organization in the way that you would like them to? 

The key is to get them to be able to solve the problems that you need now. With a data engineer, the balance of solutions versus software might be a little bit different then a data scientist. Since this person is the person that's going to sort of be maintaining the data stack for you, you need them to be able to do that in a way that's consistent with the way that your organization does things. So they need to be able to have an idea about what are the specific software and hardware needs that your organization has. 

There are a few key things that they need to know. They might need to know how to build and manage some databases, things like SQL, things like MongoDB. They might also need to know how to do things like implement or run things like Hadoop, which is a parallel processing infrastructure. Now it's not necessarily true that they
need to know any one of these buzzwords or another. But it is true that they need to have the combination of skills that allows them to build out a data infrastructure that's supportive and that can be maintained. 

There are a couple of key characteristics that you're looking for when you're looking for a data engineer. First, they need to be willing to find answers on their own. This is again, a person that often will be one of the few people that's solely responsible for the data infrastructure. Often they need be able to answer those questions themselves. They need to be able to go out and get the quotes on the Internet. They need to be able to ask questions and figure out what's the right hardware, and what are the right security measures to be taking, and so forth. Often they will have to do that a little bit on their own, in the sense that, the data engineering team is ofte very specific and expert in an area. Where it's not clear that other people within your organization will be able to give them a lot of advice. They need to know a little bit of data science. They need to know how data is used, how it's pulled, how it's analyzed. So that they know how to build the infrastructure that's useful for them. Ideally, they'll be closely collaborative with the data scientists (maybe they've done that before). And then they need to be able to work well under pressure. One reason for that is that the data infrastructure for an organization is often very critical. And if it goes down then your website might go down, or you won't be able to do any analysis, or the organization sort of grinds to a halt. Having a data engineer that's able to work well under pressure, that's able to keep things up and running, and keep things maintaining, that makes good decisions about software maintainability, and hardware maintainability, is somebody that's critical for your data engineering team. 

They need to be able to interact with people. Personal communication skills are highly undervalued but are very, very important. There's going to be a lot of steps at which a data engineer is going to have to interact, especially at first in a small organization but even later on, with data scientists, with other people in your organization, and external units. And so you need to be able to have a friendly conversation with them. Ideally, they can explain in very simple terms why they need to make certain decisions. Often, the decisions are quite technical, and quite involved with the hardware and
software. And so it's very useful if they can, in very simple language, explain what's going on, what the problem is, how it's going to be fixed, and so forth. That can be a huge advantage to your organization. 

## Data Scientist

When you're building out your data science team, one of the key roles that you'll be hiring for, no surprise, is a data scientist. This section talks a little bit about what to look for in a data scientist. 

What does a data scientist do? As it's typically defined, a data scientist runs experiments, pulls and cleans data, analyzes it and then communicates the results to people. So they have to have a set of skills that allows them to perform all of these activities. Depending on your definition of data science, you might have to move the qualifications just a little bit in one direction or another. It also depends a little bit how mature your organization is. If you're hiring dedicated data scientists, then the description above likely similar to their job description. If you're at a very early stage and you're hiring your first data science team members, they might have to be
a little bit more of a jack of all trades. They might need to be able to do a little bit more data engineering, as well as data science. The description corresponds more to a more mature organization that is hiring data scientists. 

A data scientist needs to be able to do statistics. Often they'll have learned that either in classes, so that they will have a qualification in statistics, whether it's a degree or they've taken a large number of classes, or they've taken some online classes. They probably need to know something about prediction and machine learning. That can often be learned from either statistics classes or from computer science classes that focus on machine learning. Again, you can also learn that online. 

Key areas that are covered by these topics are inference and prediction, which we've discussed in other chapters. It's important to know that some people will likely be better at one than another and it depends on what your organization is focused on doing. If you're doing more development of predictive tools, they might need to be a little stronger in machine learning. If you're trying to do experiments and come up with new hypotheses or inferences about what is effective, they might need to be a little bit better at inference. 

A data scientist also needs to be able to do data analysis, and that means the whole picture: they need to be able to pull data sets out of a database, they need to be able to clean them up and analyze datasets. Perform the statistical inference or prediction that they want to do and then communicate those results. Data communication skills involve both being able to analyze the data, create nice visualizations, communicate those visualizations and the results to people in a way that both expresses what's going on and carefully expresses how uncertain they are. When you're making decisions,
you know exactly how strongly the data are supporting the decision
that you're trying to make. 

In addition to the skills described above, data scientists usually have a few of the following skills. They usually know how to use R or
Python, which are general purpose data science languages that people use to analyze data. They know how to do some kind of visualization, often interactive visualization with something like D3.js. And they'll likely know SQL in order to pull data out of a relational database. 

The common backgrounds for data scientists are that they come from a statistics or biostatistics department, they learned a lot of applications, so they've actually worked on lots of real data sets. That's not always true in statistics and biostatistics department, but it's usually true for applied statistics and biostatistics departments. And then they've picked up a little bit of software engineering they know a little bit about version control they know a little bit about programming in other languages and so those sorts of things allow them to sort of interface with the other people in your company but they're primarily focused in training and statistics. 

Another very common route to data science is if you do some kind of quantitative background say for example physics or engineering, and then there's some sort of data science transition. So they either take some classes online, like our [data science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science), or they take some other data science program. 

The last category that's very common among data scientists is that they've actually trained in software engineering. They're actually a trained software engineer, or a working software engineer, and they just pick up some statistics. Now, they might pick that up, again, from classes online, or they might have taken some courses in college. And again, it'll depend on the mix of what your organization is looking for. Are they looking for a person that's going to do more infrastructure development blended with a little bit of statistics? Then it might be better to go for somebody with a software engineering
plus statistics background. If you already have an organization, you really need to be able to do experiments and make inferences from them. Going after somebody from a biostatistics department, for example, might be a much stronger place to go and look for your candidate. 

One thing to keep in mind is that a key component of being a good data scientist is not being intimidated by new kinds of ideas or software. In some cases it's really important that you look for somebody that has specific software engineering skills, or specific programming language and skills that your organization needs. But you'll often miss out on really strong candidates by doing that. And so, one really good idea is to assess in general, are they a go getter? Are they able to learn new things? Are they able to do the sort of general purpose data science tasks that you want? And then try to figure out if they'd be able to pick up on the fly the languages that you would need them to use for your particular problem. 

The key here is tp focus on the problem not on the software programming languages when you're looking for data scientists, because you'll tend to miss a huge swath of people, particularly right
now in the transition while the field of data science is relatively new and there's not a standardized curriculum for training data scientists across all these different disciplines. 

One of the key characteristics of data scientists that you want to have is the ability to collaborate with people to figure out what the right problem to solve is. And so they need to be able to chase that down on their own. You can't always be holding their hand. So what can you do? You can go look for evidence of this skill,  whether that's through leadership that they've taken on at their previous organizations, through active participation in open source software,
or whether it's through blogging, or something else where they communicate that they've gone out and they've actually been willing to go get the answers on their own. They need to be unintimidated by new data. 

A smart question that often gets asked when interviewing a data scientist, is to throw out a kind of data that they've never seen before, whether it's from your organization or even data that you might have just imagined from a different organization, and see how they react to it. If they react in a way that's positive, they have ideas, they think about ways to try to tackle that problem, that's great. If they're intimidated by that data type and they're just trying to force it back into the box of the data they know, that might be very challenging as your organization changes and the data science changes for them. 

In addition, it's important for a data scientist to be willing to say, I don't know. This is often hard to get out of a person in an interview, but it's important to know. If they don't know the answer to a question, because maybe you asked them a question about your organization that's very specific hat they wouldn't know the answer to, you need to see if they're comfortable saying, "I don't know," because often data come to no conclusion. It's very common for you to do an experiment and the conclusion is, we don't know very much more than we knew before we started. It's frustrating, and it's one of the hard parts about data science. But is important to know that people will, when faced with that situation, are comfortable saying "I don't know," so that you know that they'll be communicating the truth to you. 

Data science requires a lot of dedication to getting all the details right, to making sure that you interact with people in a way that moves things forward, even when they're faced with not necessarily the most friendly response in return. And so it's useful if a person is very friendly, with good people skills. Those soft skills that come with being a data scientist are critical in a data science team where they're going to be working with other people and they'll often be your point of contact with external units. It's actually a grossly under valued skill in a data scientist. In our experience, people overvalue the technical component, like "Do they know programming language X?" and de-value things like, "Can they have a conversation
with me that doesn't get testy if I'm questioning some of their
deep-held beliefs about data?" And so, this is an important component to making sure that they'll fit in well with your organization


## Data Science Manager

The last member of the data science team is a data science manager. A data science manager is responsible for building the data science team. They are responsible for identifying and recruiting data engineers and data scientists to the team; then getting them set up, setting goals and priorities, identifying those problems within an organization that need to be solved by data science, and putting the right people on the right problem. From there, they manage the data science process. 

Data science, as we'll discuss in another part of this book, is a process that's not just one time,
one thing. It's an *iterative process*, and so it needs to be managed carefully. One of the manager's
responsibilities is making sure that people routinely interact with each other
within the data science team, and also interact with other people
in the wider organization. The data science team also interacts with other groups, so the manager might report to higher managers. The manager might also just interact with,
or collaborate with people at their same level and other units of your organization, and so they need to have good
communication skills in that sense. 

What kind of skills does a data science manager need? Ideally they have knowledge of
the software and hardware being used. That's great if they have some kind of
background in either data science or data engineering. That's sort of the ideal case. That's ideal, because then they actually know the infrastructure that's involved. If there's a problem that comes up they might have a good suggestion about how to fix the data science infrastructure, or
how to fix that machine learning algorithm that doesn't necessarily work
exactly like the person wanted. They don't have to have that
qualification, but it's nice. 

The manager does need to know the roles in the team. They
need to know what a data scientist does, what a data engineer does, what other
teams are supposed to be doing, and how that may or may not be data science. They need to filter out the problems that aren't necessarily appropriate, and focus on the ones that are. They need to know what can and
can't be achieved. Data science is useful and
it can be a very powerful tool for an organization, but
it's not all purpose and all knowing. And so, there are often problems that just can't be solved with data science. That could be because
the data aren't available. It could be because algorithms aren't
good enough to be able to do that kind of prediction at that time. It could be because we can
definitely solve the problem, but we just can't scale it up to
the scale that's necessary. Manageres need to kind of have an idea of
what are the global parameters of what can be done and
what can't be done with data science.  Strong communication
skills are important for a manager because they are going to be communicating with their own team and interfacing with other units. Manageres need to be able to communicate with what's going on. 

What is the background of data managers? Data managers ideally come from
some sort of data science background. Whether that's analyzing data themselves, or building data science infrastructure
themselves, plus some management training. Another option is that you have some management experience, but you've also taken or learned a little bit
about data science and data engineering. And ideally you've learned about it at
least at the depth where you'll be able to come up with those suggestions if the people doing the work get stuck. At the high level it's good that you know
how to direct and set priorities, and know what's possible and not possible,
but ideally you can also sort of get in the mix and
help people out if that's possible. The best managers at some level or
another know enough data science or data in general that they can
contribute to the team in that way. 

Their key characteristics are that they're knowledgeable about data science and they're supportive. Data science and data engineering are often very frustrating components of
being in an organization for lots of different reasons. And so, being positive and supportive and motivational is really important when
identifying a data science manager. Being thick-skinned is also really
important, it often falls on the data science manager to report disappointing results from a prediction algorithm, or an experiment that failed, and they often have to report that to management or people that might not
be too happy about it. And so, they have to be willing to do that
in a way that's positive and friendly and quickly moves on to the next thing. 

Data science managers advocate for and use data science in a way that's really positive for the whole organization and for their team. You're looking for somebody that can organize the whole
process, keep it going, and move people onto the right problems and solve the real problems that your organization has.

# Assembling the Team

## Where to Find the Data Team

Now that you know the qualifications
of data scientists, data engineers, and data science managers, you need to know where you can go and
find those sorts of people. The obvious place to look is the general
purpose sites, LinkedIn or Monster.com or something like that, where you go out and
you search for data science. This can be a little bit hard to do,
because there are a large number of people that call
themselves data scientists. It's a hot area right now and it can be a little bit hard to identify
who are the people that are really good from who are the people that
aren't necessarily good. Now it's not impossible, you can look for the right programming languages for
each of the different roles. You can look for past experience. Ideally they have some kind of projects
online, whether that's through something like a GitHub profile where they show
their software or hardware background. So ideally you have some sort
of toehold on what they know if you go to these sort
of general purpose sites. 

Another place that you can go is you can
go to is more dedicated sites. The site kaggle.com hosts data
science competitions and also has a very large job board
with lots of people who are looking for data science jobs. There you'll  find people who
have at least a little bit of experience in data science, because you also know
if they've competed in competitions, what their skills are, and how they're doing. You can go to places like
Insight Data Science, or you can go to places like hire.com. These are more dedicated places
that are focused exclusively on hiring and building data scientists so you know a little bit more
about their qualifications. There's less
of a filtering process which may or may not be useful, depending
on how specific are the needs of your institution or your organization
versus what's being trained or what they list in these
particular websites. If you're looking for
somebody that's a little outside the mold, maybe the general purpose site might be
better with a little bit more searching. If you're looking for sort of a more
traditional data scientist or data engineer,
you might go to these more specific sites. 

You can also look at people's profiles on GitHub or other sites where they put up
all their data science projects. This way you can get
a little bit of a feel for how they work right from the start,
before you even interview them. So you can go search for them through the sort of sites
where they might have information posted because most of the online programs
programs have them build portfolios or profiles which they put online, which
makes it easier for you to find them. 

## Interviewing for Data Science

So once you've identified the people that
you want to bring in, or people who've applied to your organization,
the next step is interviewing them, and trying to figure out if they're a good
fit for your data science team. The structure of a data science
interview is usually is follows. Usually you meet
either one on one with the candidate or you have a small group
of people meet with them. Then you have some kind of demonstration or presentation, and then a demonstration of their technical skills. Those are usually the three main
components of the data science interview so we will discuss each of these. 

First is individual meetings or group meetings. How many people they'll meet at once, whether it's a few people, or one person, kind of depends on the size of your organization. Ideally they will meet both people inside the data science team as well as people outside the data science team, so you can get feedback on whether they've communicated well with both internal people and external people. So the key here is to focus on the projects that they've worked on. Try to illicit as much information as you can about how they work on projects. Whether they're go-getters, whether they can go figure it out on their own. The resume will tell you a lot about their technical skills but it will tell very little about their interpersonal skills. So this is a critical stage where you need to dissect and identify whether they are a person that will easily work with other people in your organisation. 

Ideally, you want to do this in such a way that you include people can make people a little uncomfortable as data scientists. That's going to be part of their job is they might come up with ideas or come to conclusions that aren't super popular. But you might still want to be able to communicate with them, and you'll be able to do
that in a friendly way. Here you're going to want to focus on
the global evaluation of skills. Some people have used technical recruiting questions. Although, a lot of large organizations,
including really famous data science organizations, have kind of moved away from that in interviews (i.e. the riddle type of questions, or the mathematical type puzzle questions
are sort of not in favor any more). The reason is that it's not very useful to know how somebody is going to react to a specific tricky puzzle in a very confined setting. It's better to ask general purpose questions. How would you tackle this kind of problem? How would you, in general, build out the infrastructure to solve this kind of security risk? You want to focus on their conceptual understanding. Do they know how to tackle the problems? Do they know the right
sort of language to speak? Do they know the right
technologies to talk about? Do they seem like they have experience in solving the sorts of problems that you'd ask them to solve if they
came onto your organization? 

The next key component, and some organizations don't do this, but I think it's very important when interviewing any
data scientist, data engineer, or data science manager, is to have them do some kind of demonstration or presentation. This is good for a couple of reasons. One, it's an ability for
them to show their own creativity and show their own unique contribution that they can bring to your organization. If they do a presentation about a data analysis they've done, or an infrastructure they've built, or they demo some software that they build, or if they talk a little bit about
their management techniques and how they would manage a data science team, it's important to get information about what's creative or unique about them. 

The demonstration or presentation is also a communications skills check. Almost always data scientist, data engineers, data managers, are going to have to present
their results to people. And so, it's good to evaluate right from
the get-go, are they able to do that, are they able to answer
questions on their feet. Are they comfortable with presenting
information that's technical and detailed. It's also an opportunity for
a broader group to interact with them. So you can only have so many individual or small group meetings with
any person at any given day. But if you have a nice big presentation
for them to give with a larger group of people, it gives more people
a chance to sort of weigh in on. Does this person seem like the kind
of person that would fit into our organization? 

Finally, there's often an evaluation of technical skills. Now, there are two kind of schools of thought here. One is very technical,
maybe even using riddle-like problems. The other is to actually have them try to solve a very small but real problem. So I think that the latter case is usually much more effective. For a data scientist, you might give them a very small data set, and see if they can do an analysis on it and report the results. It might take them only an hour because it's very small, or perhaps overnight if it's a somewhat larger problem. Afterwards you have an interview with them, go through what they did, and get a feel for what their
thinking process is really like. Ideally, you'd give them a problem or a project that's related to what
your organization does every day. It might be a simulated example or
a fake example, so they don't get access to any real data,
but it gives you an idea. How are they going to operate
day-to-day in the organization? 

Those are the three components, you have individual or group meetings. You have a demonstration or presentation, and then you have some evaluation of their technical skills. Then you collect all the information from everybody who saw them, and you make a judgment on whether they're a right fit for your organization.

# Management Strategies

## Onboarding the Data Science Team

Once you've hired a member of the data
science team and they show up on their first day of work, it's important that you have a system in place so that they can quickly get into the flow. It's really easy to waste a lot of time if you don't have a system for them to get all of the support and the help that
they need to get up and running as quickly as possible and really start helping your organization as fast as they can. The onboarding process for a new person usually starts with an initial meeting with
whoever their manager is. As a manager, you should 

* Go through an overview of their position and what the expectations are. In particular, what are the projects that you'd like to have them complete.
* Let them know who they are supposed to interact with and at what time scale. 
* Let them know whether you going to initiate interactions with others, or whether they need to go and start those interactions themselves. 
* Give them the contact information of any of the people that they need to be in contact with throughout the entire process. 

Often, it makes a lot of sense to set up policies for how you're going to interact with the internal team. How are you going to
communicate with them? What's okay and what's not okay
in terms of feedback and review? The same sort of thing for
external interactions. How are you going to
interact with other people? Is that all going to flow through
the management of the data science team? Or is that going to be embedding people
briefly in other teams during the week? And how are they going to
communicate with them? All of that needs to be laid out,
ideally in a short, initial meeting where they actually get
all that information in a compressed form. It's really ideal if that information could be stored somewhere internally on a level that they can interact with. Whether it's a website, or some kind
of document that's distributed, so that they can
always have a reference for who they should be contacting,
how they should be acting, and so forth. So, that's the ideal way to make sure that they always have that information available to them. 

The next step is usually human resources. They need to get set up with payroll, benefits, and obtain any kind of documentation they need. This isn't really part of the data science process, but it is always a step that needs to happen in the onboarding process for people. 

The next thing that needs to happen is introductions. This new person might have interviewed, and others might even be aware that they're showing up, but it's really good to have that person be able to go around and put a face to the name for all the people within the data science team. It's ideal if you, as the manager, can go and take them from place to place, introduce them to all the data science team, make sure they get to know them, give them a few minutes to talk, so everybody knows who the new member of the team is. You also might want to introduce them their external points of contact. Whatever external units they'll be working with, or collaborators they'll be working with, make sure that you do a direct introduction of them, so that everyone knows the new person is here. If you initiate that yourself, then it makes it a little bit smoother for them to know where to go in the organization.

Another thing that all data scientists or
data engineers will need is equipment and communications. So often they'll either have a computer,
or you'll need to get them a computer associated with the activity of
what they're going to be doing. Let them know what software is
available for them to install, what their purchasing limits are in terms
of organizing how they can get software. You also need to let them know how to
interact with your global infrastructure. How do they do data pulls? What's their username? How do they interact with the infrastructure and the hardware that you have? Ideally, you have documentation for this, whether it's a PDF or some other documentation that you can give them through the internal communication channels, that shows them where all the data is stored,
what kind of database you're using, and the way to pull
data out of that database. Essentially, this could be tutorials and introductions, so they can immediately get up and running without having to go and ask a hundred questions of the data engineer. 

Get new people quickly set up on the communication channels that are useful for you. Some organizations like to just communicate by email or through chat, with something like Slack, where they communicate with each other as a team. It's important that you get
them set up and running on whatever the communication channel is, the one that your organization particularly focuses on. 

After you've got their equipment set up and you've got them sort of ready to go, the best thing to do
with any data scientist or data engineer is to set them
up with an initial problem. Obviously what you'd like is
that this person can come in and immediately start having an impact, and
immediately identify all of the problems your organization might need to have
solved, but that usually never happens. Each organization is a little bit quirky. They have particular problems that they
care about and that they don't care about. And so the best way to get somebody up and
running immediately, is to start them on small, finite,
concrete project right away. This might be, for a data scientist,
an analysis that is just a small analysis, that they can
work on right away, that day. They can already start asking questions, and they can already start
interacting with people.

It's the same story for
data engineers or data science managers. You want to give them a short, concrete project that they
can use as a jump start. Eventually, you're going to want
them to work on larger scale projects. But if they get something under their belt, right away, that's a solution they can present, first of all, and it gives them confidence. Second of all, the best way to get them integrated into a team is to have them working on a project right away. 

So, the first thing that you do, is you give them that initial project, along with all of the other documentation that you need, and then, you turn them loose.

## Managing the Team

Once your team is up and running, the process of managing or maintaining the team as it goes forward and answers data science problems is a
critical role for a data science manager. The first thing that you would often
have with every member of your team, ideally, is individual meetings. This will happen if you
are at the first stage of management where you're managing just a few people. Once your organization
gets a little bit bigger, there'll be a hierarchical structure and you might not necessarily meet with
every member of the team every week say. But if you're only managing a few people, it's a really good idea to have a standing
regular meeting where they can come and they can present anything
that they're working on, things that they've accomplished, or things that they finished and so you can sort of check them off
as things that have gotten done. They can also discuss any kind of problems that they have and
their goals for the week. Individual meetings take up a lot
of time, but they can be a huge advantage in the sense that
people often get stuck in data science on something that can easily be resolved just by having someone else look at it. This is the best and most
effective way to get people unstuck and keep them moving. 

The second thing that makes a lot of sense to have is Data Science Team Meetings. So that's get the whole data science team together. Again, this should be a regular standing meeting that you have so that everybody can come together and talk about what they're working on. They can share any updates of any progress that they've made. They can identify any problems that they are working on, or that they're stuck on, particularly problems that maybe touch on different teams. For example, suppose the data science team can't
necessarily make a data pull that they want because
the infrastructure isn't in place. That's a good time to communicate
with the data engineering team. And then what are their goals? What are the steps that they want to take? It's also an opportunity to peer
review the progress that's being made. Data science teams can
make presentations or data engineering teams can make presentations. Everyone else can chip in, and make comments and evaluate. 

The key here is that you need to set it up in such a way, that people are empowered or able to make criticism if they need to. They can make critical comments about other people's
stuff without being rude or mean. There's a very fine line
to balance, and a lot of people have difficulty with giving criticism
well or taking criticism well. It's up to the data science
team lead to make sure that, especially when dealing with data, to be very objective to allow people to express their real opinions. It's also an opportunity for you to set team priorities and motivate people. Data science can very often become a slog and it's very hard to get all the details right when you're doing an analysis or setting up an infrastructure. When you're mired in the weeds, it's very helpful to have somebody who can come in and tell you the bigger picture. Why are we doing this? Why are we solving all these
really hard technical problems? What's the goal that we're setting and how do we get there? That's your opportunity to motivate people, keep everybody excited, and keep everybody fresh on the problems that you're working on at any given time. It's important to have both individual meetings, where each person can talk about what are their personal issues that they need to deal with or their own personal successes, and also a group meeting where everybody can come together and communicate. 

You're also in charge of monitoring interactions. It's very common, if you set your data science team up in the way that is the most optimal, to have a data science team that sits all by itself, that talks to each other and so forth. But then those people also in the data
science team spend some period of time embedded in other groups. They email those other groups, and ideally each member of your team will be responsible for interacting with one particular external unit of the organization that you're dealing with. So it's your job to  keep on top of that. To monitor how those interactions are going you can either do that actively, by being CC'd on messages,
by being involved in the Slack channel or by going to those meetings
with the external folks. Or you can do it sort of more passively, sort of accept the feedback and hear it from both the external organization and from the person that
you've embedded there. In either case, it's up to
you to monitor that and make sure that
the communication is flowing. 

A very common occurrence is either for communication to be too fast or too slow, in a sense that if it's too slow, the're not getting enough details back and forth, and the progress will slow down. If it's to fast, you might have an external unit that's making extreme demands on the data scientist. That's very common too, and so knowing how to 
modulate those sorts of requests and take some of the heat for the data scientist or data engineer that's getting those requests is something that is up to the data manager. It's up to you to keep things running, and so the best way to do this in my experience is with an open door policy. Generally it's good to have people
be able to come to you at anytime and not just at their weekly meeting or their regular individual meeting or group meeting. Have them be able to just drop by and ask questions so that they can immediately get unstuck. Some of these details are things where people get stuck for a long time on something that can easily
be solved if they talked to somebody else. And so the best way to do that is Is to have an open policy. Another way is to have a policy to quickly respond to questions via email or chat, especially if they're  things that can be resolved very quickly. You also want to be able to
minimize the amount of formal meetings that people have. There needs to be a regular meeting so you can check on progress but you don't want to introduce a large number of meetings. Data science and data engineering require large amounts of uninterrupted, concentrated effort, and so introducing too many meetings
into the lives of these people means that they'll really
slow down their work. One way to do that is by allowing
quick communication that doesn't have to resolve into a formalized meeting. 

It's also important to manage the growth of the organization and that's growth in a couple of different ways. Obviously it's growth in terms of the number of people and how they're going to be managed and how they can communicate with each other and so forth. But it's also good to manage the growth of individual people. Make sure that there are opportunities for them to learn new tools. Whether that's through giving them access to courses online or otherwise. Whether it's through presentations
in the group meeting, where people present new ideas or
new tools that they've learned about so other people can take advantage of them. Whether its introductions
to new interactions. So sometimes you'll be in meetings that
aren't necessarily the meetings that your data science team is going to, but you might identify an external group or a person that really would make a good connection with your data science team. It's your job as the data science manager to facilitate that interaction. 

A really critical component of being a data science manager is, and building a good data science team, is identifying opportunities for
advancement for your people. Anytime that there's an opportunity for your people to either get promoted or to take on new responsibilities that will look really good for them on their resume, it's up to the data science manager to sort of be on the lookout for those opportunities. This can happen through new interactions, through
learning about new tools, or through ways in which they
can promote themselves both inside the organization and externally
at conferences or at meet-ups, or anything like that where they can actually make more connections in their field.


# Working With Other Teams

## Embedded vs. Dedicated

One of the questions that often comes
up when building a data science team, is whether you should build a stand-alone
data science group all on it's own, or whether you should embed data scientists, one in each of a number of different
external management organizations. In the embedded data scientist idea,
you're taking a data scientist and you're having them sit with say,
the marketing team, or you're having them sit with the business
intelligence team, or you're having them sit with a different team than
the rest of their data science colleagues. There are some big advantages to this approach. In particular, the data scientist gets to hear about the problems every
day that that organization is having and it's a really great way
to promote collaboration. It's also a little bit difficult because the data scientists can't necessarily communicate very well with their own or other data scientists. They won't be able to ask questions if they get stuck on different problems. 

On the other hand, you could imagine setting up a independent data science group. So this depends a little bit on the scale of your organization. If you're a really small start-up organization with only one or two people, there's no need for a dedicated group. But for a larger organization, sometimes it makes sense to have them all sit together. The advantage here is that they'll be able to ask questions quickly of their peers, they'll have good support among them. The disadvantage is that they won't necessarily be on top of all the problems that necessarily they need to be on top of in order to do their job and to effectively use data for your organization. The key points when making this comparison are *communication*, *support*, and *empowerment* of data scientists. 

* **Communication**. A data scientist needs to be working on a concrete problem and those concrete problems often don't come out of the data science team. They often come out of another team, whether that's the marketing team, or whether that's the leadership, or some other part of the company or organization that you are working for. To have close communication, one option is to embed the person directly in that external unit and have them talk to them all the time. But another way is to make sure that the channels of communication are open between people in the external units and people in the data science team. Either way, the key component is that the data scientist should always be aware of what's the concrete problem they're trying to solve? And when they come up with solutions, they need to know what to benchmark against, to know what does success look like? The best way to do that is through communication with these external units. 
* **Support**. You need to support data scientists, and not only support data scientists, but that way they have the support they need to be able to help the other people in your organization. If a data scientist is embedded in an external unit, often they don't necessarily have another person that they can talk to. It can be very frustrating to perform data science. A lot of the job is very low-level data cleaning, which can be a very painful. The idea is you want to be able to have somebody that they can turn to, that they can talk to for advice or support. That often is more available in a stand-alone data science unit. They can actually go and talk to other people. But again, this can lead to an insular nature of the group being on its own. 
* **Empowerment**. One thing that's very difficult about being a data scientist in an organization is that the data often don't tell you what you want to hear. So it's very common to run an experiment and to get a result that goes against the common wisdom. Or maybe you have a great idea, a great hypothesis, so you run an experiment, and you collect the data and it turns out your hypothesis was wrong. Communicating these sorts of things to the people that had the ideas or the external units that came up with those projects can be very difficult. In particular, if the external units are upset about the results that came out of the data science project, there can be a problem because the data scientists might be incentivized to not tell you the full truth, or to not communicate exactly what happened in the experiment. Thereforew you need to empower data scientists to be able to be confident in reporting the results that were there and then to have the organization support that and make quick decisions, even when those decisions are not necessarily the way that everyone would want to work. Doing data science is not a political process, which can often make the politics very difficult for data scientists. 

One happy medium between the two ways of working, whether you embed somebody out externally, or you have a dedicated team, is to, once you're at a scale that's useful for it, have the team sit together in a way that they can all communicate with each other. They can commiserate with each other, they can empower each other to feel good about the decisions they're making about what to report. But then you make sure that they have close contact and continual contact with external groups. They might go sit for an hour a week with some group or they might go sit for a couple hours a week with another group. But they always have a home base to come back to, the data science home base, where they can feel really supported and they can have the right people to ask questions about. As long as you can encourage the right kind of communication and make sure that the team doesn't become insular, that usually tends to be the optimal arrangement, a dedicated team with close connections to individual groups. Ideally, each person on the team has one external unit that they are responsible for, or a small number of units that they're responsible for, so that they can develop long-term relationships with those units and really be effective at using data to help optimize the organization.


## How Does Data Science Interact with Other Groups?

Once you have a data science team, you
need to think about how that team is going to interact with other teams
within your organization. There a few different modes
under which that can happen. 

* **Consulting**. Consulting is an opportunity for your team to collaborate with other people where they come to you. They bring problems from outside that they want to have solved, whether it's predicting how many people will come to a certain website, or identifying how many people will click on an ad. Or any other kind of problem that's based in something that they're working on that they think machine learning, or prediction, or inference would help them out with. So that's a consulting model where they sort of come to you. 
* **Collaboration**. In collaboration, the data science team will work closely with one of your external teams to sort of build out a whole project. In that case, it might be long-term, in the sense that you might have one data scientist working with an external team, (e.g. the marketing team) for a long period of time, or with one collaborator for a long period of time. In that case, you often build a sort of a deeper knowledge of the exact role of that external person, and so that can often help in the data science process. When you're talking about just a consulting relationship, you only get a superficial idea about what the problem is that you're solving. Data science can still be useful, but it really doesn't have that deep dive effect where the person actually has expertise in the area that they're working on.
* **Teaching**. Almost all data science organizations can play a useful role by educating other people about what data science is and what data science can be used for. This is one way that the team can actually help benefit all the different teams within the organization or the other collaborative groups within the organization. A teaching role for a data science unit is always a very helpful component. One way to do that is to organize one-off events where you have a particular idea that's taught, say, how to visualize data or how to interact with data. Another is to have a standing teaching commitment where you have a boot camp for people that come in. 

Finally, you can have a data science
team be creative and propose new ideas and actually move the organization forward. There's an idea that
you could be data-driven, in a sense that you can go out and
collect data, and make all of your decisions based on the
data wisdom that you collect from those experiments. But that actually falls a little
short of being able really make transformative changes based on data. In order to make transformative changes
with data, you need to propose new hypotheses and then test those hypotheses
and see if they actually work. So it might be creating a new product and then running experiments to
see if that product works. Or might be predicting consumer behavior
or any kind of behavior that you're interested in, based on machine learning,
in a new way, in a new application. Those sorts of creative ideas can
often come from the data science team, particularly if they're involved in those
sort of close collaborative relationships where they really understand what's
the problem we're trying to solve. Maybe they have a new idea or
some new data that they can go collect, either within your organization or
externally, to answer that question. So it's always great to give your
data science team a little bit of freedom to be creative and
to come up with their own ideas.


## Empowering Others to Use Data

It's not just the people in your
data dcience team that will want to use and interact with data. So part of your role as
data science manager, or as a data science executive is
teaching people how to use data or empowering people to use
data within an organization. One of the ways in which to do that
is through data science training. There are a number of different
ways that you can do this. One is pointing people to resources,
collecting and curating resources that
are available online. Whether that's online classes or online
materials related to sorts of things that they might want to be able to do. It might be writing those
tutorials yourself, so that people can interact with
the data themselves directly. 

Another really useful way is to have internal talks that are available to everybody to go to if they want to where the data dcience team communicates how do you pull data out of the database? How do you make plots? How do you visualize data
in a way that's compelling? How do you do machine learning? Or what is machine learning? Those internal talks are really useful
if they can also communicate what the internal capabilities are. One thing that's very difficult about data science teams is that every sata science team has different capabilities. Depending on the people that are there,
how subscribed their activities are, and how difficult it is to do the problems. Communicating what's possible and
what's not possible in a way that's unbiased to the whole
organization often spurs new ideas. New ways to take advantage of the data
science team to solve new problems that people care about. You can either have  training sessions or  informational sessions about
how the data science team works. Those are both really useful ways
to empower people to approach the data science team and work with them. 

Another way is to build documents or
build tools or build products that can be
shared with other people who don't necessarily have data science or
data engineering training, but would like to interact with the data. One common example
is a dashboard, a set of visualizations or
set of plots that are built so that somebody
can click on some buttons and interact with that visualization. They can ask their own questions,
have their own hypothesis and interact with the data, even if it's just a subset of the data. Another way is just one interactive
visualization can be really compelling, that can be a way for
people to  interact with the data, ask one specific question, and  see how their choices work. Here the key is,
there's a design element to it---how are you going to
design your interface so that people can interact with the data? They can ask their own questions but they're not intimidated by syntax or
knowing how to actually do the stuff with the low-level programming
languages that you or your data science team might know about. In addition to training, there's these ways to directly
connect people to the data themselves. Ideally, you can automate this. So a lot of report writing tools,
whether they're in iPython notebooks or shiny documents or so
forth, can be  auto-generated. You can also setup a dashboard that
does an auto-pull from your database, that always has the latest and
freshest data available to people. If you can automate it in that way,
the most common questions can be answered by people other
than the data science team which leads them to innovate and
to focus on new ideas and new things that they can do well

The other thing that can be really useful
as a way to have people  interact with the data science team is with
data science idea evaluation. So often people will have ideas about
ways they think they might be able to use data that solve a particular
problem or another. But it turns out that sometimes
those are impossible. We don't have the right data or we don't
have the imaginary infrastructure, we don't have the right scale to
be able to solve that problem. But it's still really nice if you
can provide a way or a format or a forum where people can propose ideas
that they'd like to do with the data and get critical, but
positive feedback on those ideas. You don't want to immediately crush
any idea that somebody brings up. You'll never hear another idea again. But it is a good idea that helps tune expectations. What can we actually do with
the datasets that we have? Especially, if someone else
is proposing the ideas and you are letting them know, for example,

* Yes, we can do that
* No, we can't do that
* Yes, we can do that, but it would take a whole new infrastructure on the server side. 
* Yes, we can do that, but it would require us to develop a whole new machine learning infrastructure here. 

That gives people an idea about what's
going on with the data science team, what can you actually do, what are the
parameters that makes it useful for you. You can do peer review of
these ideas from the data team and from yourself as another way to
interact with the organization. But in general,
the idea is as often as possible drawing other people into
the data science process. Often that requires a little bit of
education and that education can feel like wasted time if you're not thinking
about it in the right way. But if you think about it as
an investment in the future data science capabilities of your organization. It can be a really positive, really value
compounding way of doing data science.


# Common Difficulties

## Interaction Difficulties

No matter how well you've put
the data science team together, there can often be problems when the data
science team is interacting with people outside of the team but
within your organization. This section talks a little bit
about what those problems are and how to deal with them. 

The first one is lack of interaction. This can happen especially if you have a data science team that's stand alone and there's not necessarily a standing
 commitment, to be embedded with or sitting with an external unit. If there's a lack of interaction, you have to identify what the problem is. The problem can either be
with the data scientists---they don't know how to contact the person or they don't know what questions to be asking---or it could be with the external unit. Sometimes that lack of communication is because there is nothing to do. So 
you need to identify if this is because there's not actually
a problem for them to be solving. In this case it's good to repurpose
that data scientist's time on to a different project. It might be because the external person isn't necessarily contacting
the data scientists or because your data scientist is so
busy working on a problem that they're not interacting---they're not emailing and contacting the person that they're working with. This will depend a little
bit on the scale of the project. If you're building a quick
machine learning algorithm, there should be lots of quick interaction. If you're building out a huge
scalable infrastructure for data management, it might take
a little bit longer before there's interaction with the leadership team
about that, and that's to be expected. 

If there's a lack of communication, there are a few options. You can take a more active role: Start initiating the conversation or send emails that will connect people together. You have to be very mindful of the balance of not interrupting time for data scientists and data engineers. Those sorts of uninterrupted moments
are when most of the work gets done. If you need to move personnel
from a project, whether it's for lack of motivation,
lack of good communication, or because there's not really a data science
project they're going to be working on, that's an important part of a data
science manager, or an executive's job. 

Another reason that you might have to get involved is lack of empowerment. This often happens if the data scientist is actually embedded in an external team. If this is the situation, often the data scientist will feel a little bit isolated and they might not feel empowered to make decisions. The external unit is in charge. They have to make some decisions about marketing or they have to make some decisions about
how they're going to take that data and make a decision for a product and so forth. Because data scientists in this situation don't necessarily make those decisions, they might feel that they keep presenting data ideas and showing them experimental results and they just don't listen. 

The first thing that you need to do is understand both sides, because problems can arise in one of two ways in this situation. One, the external person that they're working with can just be ignoring their advice, ignoring their data analysis. In that case, it's up to you to convince the external person, and to  take the initiative to explain why this is important, why using the data will help you do a better job, will get you better results at the end of the day. On the other hand, it could be because the data scientist is just  pushing ideas beyond the scope of the data, or they're not getting the data analysis done in a way that's convincing for the external person to look at and interact with. 

One thing that's  a common misconception about data science or data engineering is that it's basically instantaneous. Because computers are so fast, people think that also data science or machine learning is really fast to develop. But sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it takes a long time to build a really good machine learning algorithm. Part of your role is being the intermediate. Being the explainer. Why does it take so long? And then providing internal support to your data science team. And whether that's just being an ear for them to talk to or by suggesting new ideas. Very often it's by identifying when to stop. Data science and data engineering are often areas where perfect is the enemy of the very good. Once you have a pretty good solution, that might be enough to get everything done. The data scientists or data engineers, because they have pride in what they're doing, may try to optimize that machine learning algorithm for the last 3% accuracy, or save a little bit more computing power on the data engineering side. Sometimes that's necessary, but sometimes it isn't, and it's up to the data science manager
to  pay attention and manage when you're actually solving the
data science problem that matters versus when you're chasing something that
doesn't maybe necessarily matter in the grand scheme of things. 

The last problem can be lack of understanding. This could be because the data science team doesn't understand the problem that they're working on. This commonly happens when a data scientist acts in a consulting roll, when they just do a one off. People from your organization might bring one question, asking "How does this *t*-test work?" or "How does this random forest work?" In that case, the data scientist might not actually understand the underlying problem, and so they might give advice that isn't very good. Another way that this could work is,
the marketing team doesn't understand what data science can do, or the product team doesn't understand what data science can do, or any collaborator doesn't
understand what data science can do. It's up to you to  help make
sure that everyone knows what's possible and what's not possible. 

You can manage this process in a few different ways. First, make sure that, if you have a separate dedicated data science team, that they interact with other groups in
a regular way, that they're embedded for periods of time. You can ensure that there's presentations regularly to the organization both about capabilities and about new techniques and about just what's going on. Advertising the data science team within the organization can ensure that everyone knows that certain kinds of problems are problems that the data science team can handle. These are the sorts of things that can help build a understanding within the organization about what data science is and how it can help. These are a few of the ways that you could help minimize  external conflicts within the data science team.

## Internal Difficulties

No matter how well you set up your data science team, and no matter how nice the personalities are, there will always be some internal difficulties. Some of these are related to personalities and interactions between people. Some of them are related to the way data scientists and data engineers tend to work. It's up to you to set up an environment where these sorts of problems are minimized and it's possible to  keep the process moving as quickly and as friendly a way as possible. 

The first thing that can happen is there can be interpersonal conflict. This happens in any organization, but when you're dealing with heavily quantitative folks who often are a little bit introverted and maybe have a little bit less interpersonal
interaction than people in other external units might have, you can end up with some difficulties of interaction. It's very helpful to right up front have a policy on the Code of Conduct. This policy can cover all sorts of things, but it should definitely
cover all of the biggies. Obviously, you don't want to have any put downs on the basis of sexual orientation or on the basis of race or on the basis of sex. All of that can be built into the policy, but it can also cover more subtle things and
data science specific things. 

For example, if there's going to be code review, if one person is going to review someone else's code, you might set up the parameters for how that's going to happen. Are they going to make the suggestions? Are they going to immediately submit changes or fixes to people's code? Are they going to do that in a way where
they communicate with the person who originally wrote the code or not? When people are reviewing each other's code and in group meeting how are they
supposed to communicate? Are they supposed to be critical? How are they supposed to be impartial? How are they supposed to interact with each other? Now this seems a little bit pedantic to have these sorts of things set up in advance, but it can really save you a lot of trouble in the long run. It also helps becuse in a data science
organization there are often uncomfortable truths that you discover with data. Whether it's something you didn't quite expect or a product or a machine learning algorithm that failed. Having a Code of Contact in place to prevent personal feelings from being hurt is a critical component. 

In that Code of Conduct it also makes a lot of sense to explain what you mean by success and failure. If you only define success by the machine learning algorithm works or the software never has bugs in it or the hardware never goes down, there will be a lot of failure. But if you define success as identifying problems, tackling those problems, and not always getting an answer that everyone expects, you reduce the pressure on any individual analysis, and that allows people to act more impartially and really let the data speak for itself. 

In addition to this policy you need to have open communication. Allow people to communicate directly with you, and with each other, about whether that policy is being enforced. And make sure that they feel empowered to have that conversation with each other. This is critically important, both in a general sense, but also very specifically for data science. It needs to be a policy that open criticism of each others' data analysis, or other people's data infrastructure, is accepted and embraced, but at the same time, isn't made to make people feel awful or isn't used to hurt people. It's just used to improve the entire process. If you organize it in that way, people will be open to criticism and they'll be willing to make changes if they don't feel like it's going to hurt their job and their job prospects. The other thing is, in the extreme circumstance where people are not adhering to the Code of Conduct, for either  general purpose reasons or for data science specific reasons, it's very useful to have outlined what are the steps that are going to take place. What's the enforcement? Whether it's something like, "I'm going to point out when you're
behaving incorrectly in a code review" or whether it's something
like at a certain stage, you'll be barred from coming to this
meeting for this period of time. Whatever it is that you need to establish, it's better to say it up front, rather than to invent policies on the fly when dealing with a data science team, especially when you're dealing with
diverse people who have different expertise, and maybe different
expectations about what's going on.
